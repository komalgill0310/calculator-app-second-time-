# **Summary**
<font size=5>

Until now, this has been the most challenging application. My initial thoughts were that I could never finish it since I have never built anything so complex before. The only thing I could do was to keep going and take small steps forward. By completing this application, I have also strengthened my knowledge of passing arguments, parameters, and creating eventListeners on buttons. 

* **Tools Used:** 
  * Ternary Operator
  * If Statements
  * AddEventListener
  * Switch Statement
  * Arguments, Parameters
